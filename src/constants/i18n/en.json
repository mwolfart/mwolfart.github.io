I have 5+ years of experience with front-end programming, 3+ years of experience with ReactJS and a little more than 1 year of experience with NextJS. Besides these frameworks, I have also worked with Angular, TailwindCSS, MaterialUI, Styled Components, unit testing, among other tools.",
        "paragraphThree": "Besides coding, I like sports, music, and video-games - mainly metroidvanias and side-scrollers (yes, I am huge Nintendo fan). On weekends I really like to go skating while listening to a good synthpop from the 80s. I also love hiking and exploring the nature."
