        "emafyLong": "<p>This is a custom wrapper for Spotify, which can be used to visualize and play songs, artists, albums and playlists.</p><p>The project was created using primarily React and Styled Components, and the main goal was to learn these frameworks, improve my skills with them, and study front-end concepts. Furthermore, it was used to experiment with multiple React libraries, such as infinite scroll, jest, and font awesome. It was also used to perform a migration from CRA setup to Parcel.</p><p>This project was first created with the help of Afonso Ferrer, a coworker of mine, and later on maintained by me. The website is deployed at Github Pages.</p>",

The user can log all of their daily expenses, assign them to custom categories and view a monthly or periodic dashboard in order to keep track of financial goals.</p><p>The project was designed using Remix, Prisma, MongoDB and TailwindCSS. The main goals here were to A) replace a set of spreadsheets I was using to keep track of my expenses and B) learn Remix and acquire a little bit of experience with MongoDB.</p><p>Further instructions on how to use the application can be found in the project ReadMe on its repository in Github.</p><p>An initial version of the app is available at <a href=\"https://expensable.vercel.app/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Vercel</a></p>",

It was developed using AstroJS and Tailwind, following a view transitions tutorial by Jack Herrington (available on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lISvyIaSRyk\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"blank\">Youtube</a>).</p><p>The first version was a very bland one developed with pure React, React Router and class components, while the second one was created with NextJS and Tailwind. All versions used a design developed by myself.</p><p>The main reason for developing a third version in favor of the second one is the effectiveness of AstroJS for this type of project (and to also try a few more transitions).</p>",
